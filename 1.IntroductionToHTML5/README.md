Pre-HTML Time's:

    Imagine a time where websites didn't exist, and our only primary source of information was books.
    It would take good amount of time & effort for us to track down the exact piece of information you were looking for.

HTML Time's:

    Today we can open a browser &  search engine of our choice, search with relevant keywords and the information is in our fingertips. Most probable chances are some one has designed a website with your exact search keywords in mind.

I am excited to begin my journey of learning to build websites using HTML.

HTML Abbreviation:

    Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML Definition:

    HTML gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as for example, headings, paragraphs or images etc.

Common HTML Terms:

    1.elements
    2.tags
    3.attributes 
                are the most common terms encountered while getting started with html

Elements:

    Elements define the structure and content of objects with in a page
    Some of the most frequently used elements are:
    1. headings- h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6
    2. paragraphs p
    3. anchor a
    4. divisions div
    and many more....

Tags:

    The use of less than < and greater than > brackets surrounding an element creates a tag.
    Tags mostly occur in pairs of opening & closing tags.
    An opening tag marks the beginning of an element
        It consists of less-than sign followed by element's name and than ends with a greater than sign.
        For examples: 
        
            <h1>, <p>, <a>, <div>

    An closing tag marks the ending of an element
        It consists of less-than sign followed by a forward slash and the element's name and than ends with a greater than sign.
        for example: 
            
            </h1>, </p>, </a>, </div>
    The content that falls between opening and closing tags is the content of that element.
        for example:

            <h1> Heading 1 </h1>, <p> Parapgraph </p>

Attributes:

    Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element.
    Most common attributes are:

        id - which identifies an element
        class - which classifies an element
        src - which specifies a source for embeddable content
        href - which provides hyperlink reference to a linked resource

    Attributes are defined within the opening tag after an element's name
    Attributes include a name and a value
    The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value
    For Example: 
    
        <a href="https://MB_Vlogs.com">Bharat Majjiga</a>
