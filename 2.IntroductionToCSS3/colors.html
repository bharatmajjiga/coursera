    <p class="first">This text color may vary from one browser to another, that's because we have used color names to mention the color, and diff browsers may use diff combinations of rgb to diplay this color. Hence it may vary from one to another</p>
    <p class="second">This text color will not vary from one browser to another, because we have used hexadecimal no's to mention the color to be used.</p>
    <p class="three">This text color will also be displayed the same in all browsers, beacuse we have rgb to denote the color</p>
